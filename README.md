## Attributions

I took huge inspiration from a youtube channel called "Cooper Codes".

I made the to do checklist app with the guidance from this youtube video. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnTfpmVzxQc&ab_channel=CooperCodes]

In this video, he demonstrates how to create a To Do List / Checklist app with sveltekit.
He goes over how to create the scripts, loop through the tasks with svelte, creating the logic for editing and deleting tasks, and finally he goes over how to render the input from user when they "add" task.
This video is extremely in-depth and provides you with the knowledge to be able to create your own app for future projects.
